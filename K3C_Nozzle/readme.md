> Hi, I have asked anycubic support and they have provided me with an image with the nozzle specifications, the problem is that I can't find any store where the exact specifications of the nozzles they sell are listed ￼
￼
> By the way, if anyone finds out where to buy decent hardened steel nozzles for the K3C, please let us know. I found some on Aliexpress, but at 0.99 I doubt that their quality is what I need. (I would like at least the hole to be round)
